EE364a 1: Introduction
General optimization problem: 
    hard to solve
    compromise: computation time, not always finding the solution(may not matter in practice)
Exceptions:
    least-squares problems: 
        analytical solution
    linear programming problems: 
        no analytical solution
        mature tech
    convex optimization problems: 
        no analytical solution  
        alomost mature
        many tricks for transforming into convex form
        difficult to recognize, but could solve many problems

EE364a 2: Convex sets
    Affine set: contain line through any two distince points in the set
    Convex set: contain line segment through any two distince points in the set

    Convex Combination: points
    Convex Hull: set of all Convex Combinations

    Conic(nonnegtive) Combination
    Convex Cone: set of all conic Combination

    Hyperplanes: 正交
    Halfspace

    Euclidean Balls
    Ellipsoids：(x - x_c)^T P^(-1) (x - x_c) <= 1

    Norm Balls
    Norm Cone

    Polyhedra: intersection of finite number of halfspaces

    Positive Semidefinite Cone

    Operations that preserve convexity

Operations that preserve convexity
    1. apply definition
    2. obtained from simple convex sets(hyperplanes, halfspaces, norm balls...) by operations:
        intersection
        affine functions
        perspective fundtion
        linear-fractional functions


subgradient: gradient of nonsmooth function
dual problem: 
    find the best lower bound for the primal problem
    Objective function -> Lagrangian(x, lambda, mu) -> Maximum (q(lambda, mu) = min(Lagrangian(x, lambda, mu))
Stop criterial:
    duality gap: faster than primal (common sense)  https://www.pythonf.cn/read/80133
    gradient norm
